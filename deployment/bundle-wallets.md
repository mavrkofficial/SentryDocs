# Bundle Wallets

Bundle wallets are optional wallets used for distributing bundle buys during deployment.

## Create Bundle Wallets

1. Open Sentry Menu -> Deployer -> Deployer Settings
2. Tap Bundle Wallets
3. Enter the number of wallets to generate (1 to 20)

## View Bundle Wallets

1. Open Sentry Menu -> Deployer -> Deployer Settings
2. Tap Bundle List

## Best Practices

- Create wallets before enabling Bundle Buy
- Keep a record of bundle wallet addresses
- Fund them only if using external bundle funding

Bundle wallets are managed automatically by the bot once created.
