# Quick Start Guide

Get your Telegram group trading with Sentry Bot in minutes using the Sentry Menu.

## Step 1: Add the Bot to Your Group

1. Open your Telegram group (private group or supergroup)
2. Add `@Sentry_Trading_Bot`
3. Keep the group private (public channels are not supported)

## Step 2: Promote the Bot to Admin

The bot needs admin permissions to read messages and operate correctly.

1. Group Settings -> Administrators
2. Promote Sentry Bot
3. Enable Read Messages (required)
4. Optional: Delete Messages, Pin Messages

## Step 3: Initialize the Bot (Owner Only)

The owner initializes the bot in the group. The bot will:

- Ask for a group name (first time only)
- Create a Group Wallet for trading
- Create a Deployer Wallet for token launches

## Step 4: Fund Your Group Wallet

1. Copy the Group Wallet address from the initialization message
2. Send SOL from any wallet (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
3. Keep a SOL buffer for gas fees

You can view balance from the Balance button in the menu.

## Step 5: Open the Sentry Menu

Use Telegram's chat menu button to open Sentry Menu.

## Step 6: Set Up Traders and Payouts

As the owner:

1. Settings -> Traders -> Add Trader
2. Settings -> Payouts -> Set Payout Wallet (each trader should do this)

## Step 7: Configure Buy Amount (Optional)

Set the default trade size:

Settings -> Group Call/DCA Amount

## Step 8: Make Your First Trade

1. Call -> send the token address
2. Positions -> check the position
3. Sell or Take Profit when ready

## Common Issues

### Bot does not respond
- Bot is admin
- Group is private
- The owner has completed initialization

### "Bot not initialized"
- Ask the owner to complete initialization

### "You must be a trader"
- Ask owner to add you in Settings -> Traders
- Set a payout wallet in Settings -> Payouts
