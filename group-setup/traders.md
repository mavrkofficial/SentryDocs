# Configuring Traders

Traders are users with permission to execute trades on behalf of the group. The trader flow is menu-based.

## What is a Trader?

A trader can:

- Call tokens (buy)
- DCA into positions
- Sell or take profit
- Set a payout wallet

Trading permissions are separate from Telegram admin status.

## Adding Traders (Owner Only)

1. Open Settings -> Traders
2. Tap Add Trader
3. Send the user's Telegram @username when prompted

## Viewing All Traders

1. Open Settings -> Traders
2. Tap Traders List

## Automatic Trader Addition

Users are auto-added as traders when they set a payout wallet in Settings -> Payouts.

## Trader Permissions

### Traders Can
- Trade via Call, DCA, Sell, Take Profit
