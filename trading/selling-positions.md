# Selling Positions

The Sell button closes a position and converts it back to SOL. If the trade is profitable, the bot distributes profits automatically.

## How to Sell (Menu Flow)

1. Open Sentry Menu -> Sell
2. Choose a position from the list
3. Confirm the sale (100 percent)

## What Happens After Selling

If profitable:

- SOL returns to the Group Wallet
- Profit is distributed to payout wallets
- PnL is recorded

If not profitable:

- SOL returns to the Group Wallet
- Loss is recorded (no distribution)

## What You'll See

- Transaction signature
- Amount sold
- Entry vs exit price
- PnL and ROI

## Selling vs Take Profit

Use Sell when you want to close the entire position. Use Take Profit for partial exits.

## Best Practices

1. Review the position in Positions
2. Coordinate exits with your group
3. Avoid panic selling

---

Sell closes the position completely. If you want partial exits, use Take Profit instead.
