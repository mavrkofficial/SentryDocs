# Sentry Bot User Guide (Menu Edition)

Welcome to the Sentry Bot User Guide. This documentation is updated for the button-driven Sentry Menu experience. Instead of typing commands, users navigate through menus and tap buttons to trade, manage settings, and view performance.

## What is Sentry Bot?

Sentry Bot turns your Telegram group into a decentralized hedge fund on Solana. Pool capital, trade together, and automatically distribute profits based on performance.

### Key Features

- Button-driven trading: Call, DCA, sell, and take profit from the menu
- Shared profit distribution: Automatic profit splits to payout wallets
- Performance analytics: Stats, PnL, and leaderboards on demand
- Token deployment: Deploy tokens and manage bundle wallets
- Yield harvesting: Harvest LP fees from deployments
- Smart routing: Best prices via Jupiter and Orca

## The Sentry Menu (New Interface)

Open the menu from Telegram's chat menu. The main buttons are:

**Call  DCA  Sell  Take Profit  Balance  Positions  Settings  Stats  Leaderboard  PnL  Deployer**

Each button guides you with prompts and follow-up buttons, so you never need to remember command syntax.
